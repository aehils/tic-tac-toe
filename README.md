# tic-tac-toe

Simple tic-tac-toe game built with react. Im going to dress it up and add more features to the UI.

Enjoy!

### Guidance
1. To run the game, first clone the repo. Use either of the commands below; personally I prefer to use SSH to clone. Or hey, you can download the zip if you're a little kookoo

      ```
      # clone with http
      git clone https://github.com/aehils/tic-tac-toe.git
      
      # OR clone using SSH
      git clone git@github.com:aehils/tic-tac-toe.git
      ```
2. Go into the new cloned folder, and install a package manager like `npm`, `yarn` or `pnpm`. Compile the program and run a server to view in your brower. For example, to install `npm` and start the server you can run
   
       
       npm install
   
       npm start
       
   
   And the program should pop up in your browser. You will also see from your terminal a message from the package what port on your local machine you can visit to interact with the program - usually 'localhost:3000'
